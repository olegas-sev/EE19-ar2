/////////////////////////////////////
// 4 OOP Principles
////////////////////////
// Short description
//
// 1. Abstraction
// - Don't include data user doesn't need away
//
// 2. Encapsulation
// - Encapsulate data regular user doesn't need in order to use
//
// 3. Inheritance
// - Making all props and methods of a class available to a child class, form a hierarchical relationship between them
//
// 4. Polymorphism
// - Child classes can overwrite method that was inherited from a parent class
